    <p><h1>Kaitlyn's Design Document</h1>
    <p><h2>Purpose of "Write with Me"</h2>
    <p>For people to be able to work together on creative writing and build a community where others work together to create.
         The goal is for people to collaborate successfully so others can read their work and give them feedback. People would 
         be able to gain new reading material here as well as a network of people who would like to help them get better at their
          craft. Writing is seen usually as a solitary work, but with the help of others it can become something new that you’ve 
          never thought of before. While the writing may not be traditionally published, having others read and enjoy your work 
          can be very uplifting.</p>
    <p><h2>Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Case 1: An aspiring writer is working on a science fiction piece, something they don’t have a lot of experience in, 
            so when they get writer’s block they post onto the website asking for feedback and help moving forward in her story. 
            Someone writes three pages in collaboration with her, and gives her helpful tips on how to keep the story going, and 
            together they produce a larger piece together.</li> 
        <li>Case 2: A college professor teaching an intro level creative writing class wants their students to get out of their 
            comfort zone, so they suggest posting a 500 word story and collaborating with those in class. The students all gain 
            new writing experiences from commenting on other’s works as well as strangers who may give them feedback</li>
        <li>Case 3: After working on pieces together for a few month through the website, two writers agree to work on a longer 
            piece together in collaboration and end up making something they’re really proud of after working together for a few months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Audience</h2>
    <P>The main audience will be writers of all ages, but probably with a bit of a lower skill in writing. This is a great place
         to start working together and learning how to give and receive feedback. It will also be available for those who love 
         to read. I want this to be an open source for people to read and write freely. Some questions I asked those in my target audience inlucde </P>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Would you use this website to write with others more or to read other’s work?</li>
    <li>Could this website be more interesting if there were contests? If yes, are there ways that would make it more interesting that others?</li>
    <li>How could this website be useful to collaborators or people trying to get their work read?</li>
    <li>Would being able to subscribe to writers make it easier to work with them or read their stuff?</li>
    <li>What suggestions would you give to make this the best collaborative experiences for everyone? </li>
    <li>Would blind collaborations make you interested in it? Such as the second person to collaborate wouldn’t see the first’s name and the first would only accept to publish the collaboration after they read it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary: Most people I asked were interested in being able to work and network with other people. Some didn’t think that it would 
    be helpful to get published off of, but would still be interested in using the website to work on things they’d like to someday get 
    published. Most said there would have to be some sort of website-wide rule to make collaboration easier and they weren’t very 
    interested in blind collaborations, rather just working off of any work someone is interested in working on together.</p>
    <p><h4>Website Refrences</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.tor.com/">https://www.tor.com/</a>    Good for reading and responding to stories, but it has a lot of more well-known people’s work featured rather than people who are starting out.</li>
        <li><a href="https://medium.com/">https://medium.com/</a>     Great for getting your content out there in any way. It is in blog form so it is very easy for people to be able to work with each other.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.swoonreads.com/">https://www.swoonreads.com/</a>   If you’re looking to get published this a great place to start, but there is no guarantee that people will read your work enough for it to get noticed.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.getunderlined.com/create/">https://www.getunderlined.com/create/</a>   incredibly user friendly and a great place to showcase your work, though it is not solely focused on people who write.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.writerscafe.org/">http://www.writerscafe.org/</a>  Great place for community, but is a bit older in design and looks, so not many younger people are using it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Presentation Information</h2>
    <p>I want to show people’s works on the front page along with information from me, such as contests or featured writers. 
        The front page will have scrolling info with information from me, and under that will be the newest pieces produced 
        by writers. On the top navigation bar, there will be buttons that say “Read” “Write” “Collab” and “Profile”. All but 
        the profile tab will have a drop down menu where you can go to certain pages. The profile tab is where you’ll keep 
        personal info and writings you’ve previously done. The newest writings will be available first, since I want those 
        without much exposure to get as much as possible on the front page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home page: The Navigation bar will be at the top of each page with there being 3 tabs to click on with drop 
                down menus. Under that there will be a scrolling feature of information that is curated for the day. Beneath 
                that will be the newest works submitted so the authors have a chance to be read. It will display the name of 
                the piece, author, date published, genre, word count, and the first few sentences. At the top there will be a 
                search bar and a place to login or access your account.</li>

            <li>Read page: a page where you may sort through the works by “newest” “genre” and “featured.” Each story will be 
                provided a space for their title, name, date published, genre, word count and the first few sentences. Each 
                story will also have its own tags to be searched by.</li>

            <li>Write page: There will be a place to fill a text box with your story (or you may write it out if you want in the text box). 
                There will be a smaller text box to write out personal tags. On the side will be a place to name the piece, select 
                the genre, a place to save it for later. If it is a collaboration there is a box under that one to choose if it 
                can be collaborated on and to tag the person it is a collaboration with, and once they’re tagged they’ll be 
                notified of it being published.</li>
            
            <li>Collab page: this is where stories that need a collaborator will be. It will be essentially the same as the 
                read page, but these will be specifically tagged as works that are looking for a collaborator.</li>

            <li>Profile page: There will be a place to put personal information and a picture, and in the middle will be the 
                work you’ve written, a tab for collaborated works, and a tab for liked stories.</li>

        </ul>
    <p><h2>Wireframe</h2>

    <p><a href="final_project/final_project/wireframe.pdf">Wireframe</a>
    <p><h2>Media</h2>
    <p>The only media will be photos and pictures. Any that I upload will be of my own or stock photos, so as to avoid any 
        copyright issues. Profiles will have the capabilities of uploading their own pictures as well. The reason to have 
        it will to be to provide a visual for the stories as well, so people can have something to set their story apart by another element.
    <p><h2>Color Scheme</h2>
    <p>The back ground will be an ivory, the font will mostly be black, the accent colors will be a <span style="color: pink;"> light pink</span> and a 
        <span style="color: Thistle;">light purple</span> for fonts, buttons and other boxes. By using these colors there is nothing very distracting 
        about them, so readers will be focused on the words against the lighter background
