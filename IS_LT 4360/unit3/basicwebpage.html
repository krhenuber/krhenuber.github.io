    <h1>Kaitlyn's Basic Webpage</h1>

    <p>Some things I think that would make a good webpage would have to include a way to interact with the content provided. 
        On this project I was thinking that it would be nice if people were able to upload their own works to my website to 
        have others look at and give contrusctive critisim. I want my page to be an area for writers to work together and get
        good insight from others. This is an important thing when it comes to writing so people can hopefully produce the best 
        work they can and have others enjoy it. </p>

<p><h3> Some ways that people may be able to collaborate include:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Work together on projects through the website.</li>
    <li>Offer ideas and prompts to others.</li>
    <li>Give feedback on other's works so they may be able to improve.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways people can collaborate over projects on the internet, and I want to help people do just that. Collaboration
    is important because it helps get new ideas on the page that you may have never thought of before. Writing with others, or just
    having them help you out a little is a great way for people to really come together and blend styles into something totally new
    and amazing. 
</p>

<p>To help facilitate this I may have a page dedicated to helping people collaborate well with each other, and respectfully. In the article 
    <a href="https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/08/21-tips-for-creating-a-successful-writing-collaboration/">21 Tips for Creating a Successful Writing Collaboration</a>
    by Helen Sedwick states that to make a successful collab there should be some sort of rules set out.<blockquote cite="https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2014/08/21-tips-for-creating-a-successful-writing-collaboration/">
    To improve the odds of a successful writing partnership take the time to put the collaboration agreement in writing. Most people
     resist this idea. Like a prenuptial agreement, it kills the romance. They donâ€™t realize the process of preparing an agreement may
      be more valuable than the result. If writers do a good job discussing issues at the start, they are less likely to have misunderstandings later.
    </blockquote>
    When I make the website I will probably have some elements from her article as well as other sources or even just my own set of rules.
    I want this website to be a friendly and helpful place for creative writers.
