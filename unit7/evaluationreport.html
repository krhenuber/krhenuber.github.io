    <p><h1>Evaluation for Write With Me</h1></p>
    <p><h3>Evaluators</h3></p>
    <p>Jill: My Roommate, and an English Major. She is qualified because she knows what people in her field may like. She doesn’t know much about code but she knows a bit about design. I think her knowledge will help me fine tune what people may want in the end. She used a Macbook Air and Google Chrome the latest version.</p>

    <p>Jordan: a Friend that has had experience coding. He wanted to help me understand what I may be doing wrong in the code, but he doesn’t know much about the content that I wanted to put up. I think that he’s most helpful when it comes to what I may do in my code to improve it. He used a Macbook Pro with the latest version of Safari.</p>

    <p>Francesca: a Classmate in an English class. She is also interested in coding and websites, though I don’t think she’s made one herself. I think she tells me what it right and wrong without holding back, which I appreciate. Her comments will really help me to update my website. She used a Mac desktop at the library, with Safari.</p>

    <p><h3>Summary of Evaluations</h3></p>
    <p>The design of the website seems fine to the evaluators, but they all said that the only picture just seemed to be there and held no purpose.  They all liked my concept but said that it doesn’t seem to show up and there should be some changes made to the concept, which I agree with. ON the surface everything seems fine to evaluators, but Francesca points out that all of my links go somewhere else on my website and that nothing makes her want to return to the website. As for the fine details they all seem to agree that I missed out on all of them, and I agree. I think that they all want my concept to change, but it was a good one I just didn’t have the skills to make it come to fruition. </p>

    <p><h3>Cases</h3></p>
    <p>This website did not live up to the cases or my own expectations. I bit off more than I could chew and I didn’t realize it until now. I think with an updated concept I can make some new cases, such as a great resource still for teachers and other writers, just in a different way that makes it better.</p>

    <p><h3>The Changes</h3></p>
    <p>It can’t be an upload based website. So instead it will be a resource for people to learn how to collaborate effectively with others through a list of rules, outside videos, examples, and tips. This won’t take away the original concept completely but it is an overhaul I need to do in order to create website that I can manage with my skill set.</p>

    <p><h3>Reflection</h3></p>
    <p>With each evaluation, I sent the paper to the people I wanted to take a look, and then I spoke to them face to face afterward for some more feedback that wasn’t on the paper. I think that it helped me more to get feedback from them in this way because it helped me a lot more to understand what they wanted to see from my website. Jordan helped me when I asked about coding and he pointed out what I may need to change in that area. Jill helped me come up with a better concept and Francesca helped me overall with her comments on how to fix everything I was doubting. This was great experience so I can make what I want and also make it substantive instead of just surface level stuff.</p>
